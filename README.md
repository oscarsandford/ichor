# Ichor/Ichora
A simple paint/sketching application to satisfy the lack of a built-in MS Paint equivalent on Pop OS. 

Minimal or no GUI, just a canvas for drawing stuff. Using SDL.

## TODO
- [x] Freehand lines.
- [x] Colour selection.
- [x] Canvas clear.
- [ ] Pen width selection (via mouse scroll). Involves changing freehand point to circle shape.
- [ ] Visual outline for pen pointer (reflects pen width).
- [ ] Save the canvas to a designated folder.
