# ichor
Paint application for Linux. Minimal or no GUI, just a canvas for drawing stuff.

## TODO
- [ ] Freehand lines.
- [ ] Colour selection.
- [ ] Pen width selection (via mouse scroll).
- [ ] Visual outline for pen pointer (reflects pen width).
- [ ] Button to press that saves the canvas to a designated folder.
